	Ch5mpy (pronounced "champy") provides a set of objects for easily dealing with h5 objects in python. It works by
	implementing abstractions above h5py's Files, Groups and Datasets objects (https://www.h5py.org/).
	
	It provides :
	- H5Dict: an object behaving as regular Python dictionaries, for exploring Files and Groups.
	- H5Array: an object behaving as Numpy ndarrays for dealing effortlessly with Datasets while keeping the memory
	usage low. This works by applying numpy functions to small chunks of the whole Dataset at a time.
	
	It also adds pickling to h5py objects.
