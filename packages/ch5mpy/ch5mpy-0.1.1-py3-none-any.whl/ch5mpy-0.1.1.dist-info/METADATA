Ch5mpy (pronounced "champy") provides a set of objects for easily dealing with h5 objects in python. It works by
implementing abstractions above h5py's Files, Groups and Datasets objects (https://www.h5py.org/).

It provides :
- H5Dict: an object behaving as regular Python dictionaries, for exploring Files and Groups.
- H5Array: an object behaving as Numpy ndarrays for dealing effortlessly with Datasets while keeping the memory
usage low. This works by applying numpy functions to small chunks of the whole Dataset at a time.

It also adds pickling to h5py objects.
