# H-wave

H-wave is a program for performing unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) approximation
for itinerant electron systems.
The UHF method approximates two-body interaction terms into one-body ones by
taking account of the fluctuations up to the first order. The wave functions
and energies are determined self-consistently by an iterative method.
H-wave treats two types of UHF approximation: one is real-space and the other is
wavenumber-space UHF methods using translational symmetry. In the wavenumber space
UHF method, the input file defining the one-body and two-body interactions is
based on the Wannier90 format, and the program can be smoothly connected to
the softwares for deriving effective models from first-principles calculations.
