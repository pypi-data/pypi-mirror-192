Firebird base modules for Python
================================

The `firebird-base` package provides common Python 3 modules used by `Firebird Project`_
in various development projects. However, these modules have general applicability outside
the scope of development for `Firebird`_ Â® RDBMS.

Topic covered by `firebird-base` package:

* General data types like `singletons`, `sentinels` and objects with identity.
* Unified system for data conversion from/to string.
* `DataList` and `Registry` collection types with advanced data-processing cappabilities.
* Work with structured binary buffers.
* Global registry of Google `protobuf` messages and enumerations.
* Extended configuration system based on `ConfigParser`.
* Context-based logging.
* Trace/audit for class instances.
* General "hook" mechanism.
