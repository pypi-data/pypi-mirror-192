The module quinten_graph provides tools to help:
- implement harmonized setting with respect to Quinten graphic chart
- explore data
- plot graphs for several variable at the same time

The notebook sandbox.ipynb is here to let you play with the tool.

Settings and variables used for the plots are managed through the class QuintenSettings defined in settings.py.
Plotting functions are defined in plotting.py

Doc for creating package:
- General procedure: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/
- Example of pyproject.toml with dependencies https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html
- Info on file MANIFEST.in: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#manifest-in

Procedure for updating package:
- Make your changes in local repo
- Push
- Increment version in pyproject.toml
- in terminal pointing to folder where pyproject.toml is located, type: `python -m build`  
(if build is not installed, `pip install` it)  
You should get the following output "Successfully built quinten_graph-[VERSION].tar.gz and quinten_graph-[VERSION]-py3-none-any.whl"
- in same terminal, type : `python -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*`  
(if twine is not installed, pip install it)  
You will be prompted for pypi credentials (@ get in touch with v.vincentelli@quinten-france.com idf needed). Then the upload should complete and you will get a link to the package

Tasks:
- [ ] : Present the tool to Anna and Rami. Reminder: the objective is to have plots ready to copy and paste in presentations. skim over the plots and read through the following questions:
  - ~~Large color palette to define~~
  - Font Arial ok ?
  - Other graphs to add to sandbox ,otebook ?
  - Arrangement (titles, legend, xticks)
    - [ ] : before presenting add few graphs (prévison VS reel), check PBIs, pres projet DSN
- [x]: enlever fond gris seaborn
- [ ]: palette daltonien
- [x]: publier sur QF>packages_internes>  quinten_graph
- [ ]: étudier possibilité de d'étendre ce concept à PBI
