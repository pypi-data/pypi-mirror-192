        ### Prerequisites
        Before you start the analysis, you need to specify where your data is located and where you want to store the results.

        Set these in the [Config](http://localhost:8501/Config) :
        - **AUTORAD_INPUT_DIR**: where AutoRadiomics should look for data.
        - **AUTORAD_RESULT_DIR**: where AutoRadiomics should store the immediary and final results.

        ### Quickstart
        To start using AutoRadiomics, you need volumetric imaging data in **DICOM** or **NIfTi** format.

        You will also need segmentations of your regions of interest (ROIs).
        If you don't have them, check out the [Automatic segmentation](http://localhost:8501/Automatic_segmentation/).

        Once you have both images and segmentations, start with:

        #### 1. Feature extraction workflow ðŸ”¨
        It consists of three steps:
        - 1.1 [Gathering the dataset](http://localhost:8501/1.1_Gather_dataset/)
        - 1.2 [Testing and preparing the dataset](http://localhost:8501/1.2_Prepare_dataset/)
        - 1.3 [Feature extraction](http://localhost:8501/1.3_Extract_radiomics_features/)

        Once you have the table with extracted radiomics features, you can start building predictive models for your task.

        #### 2. Binary classification workflow ðŸ§ 
        It includes two steps:
        - 2.1 [Training ML models](http://localhost:8501/2.1_Train_models/)
        - 2.2 [Model evaluation](http://localhost:8501/2.2_Evaluate/)

        When you're satisfied with the results, you can use it to make predictions on new data:
        - 3. [Make predictions](http://localhost:8501/3._Predict/)

        #### Other workflows
        If you're interested in generating volumetric map of radiomics features, check out:
