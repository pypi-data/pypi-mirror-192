KSP Trajectory Optimizer.

This project is a reduced-scope version of [one of my other (currently incomplete) projects](https://github.com/itchono/gravity-assist-flyby-optimizer), as an intermediate stepping stone.

This tool computes trajectories between celestial bodies in KSP based on on-rails two-body patched conics, incorporating trajectory correction maneuvers for a variety of mission scenarios, such as:

* Ballistic Hohmann transfers for other planets
* Gravity assist flyby routes

Computationally-intensive code is implemented in C, with a Python wrapper made using `cffi`.
C code follows mostly C89, with some C99 features used. It has been tested against the latest versions of GCC (on Linux) and MSVC (on Windows 10).

# Installation

The simplest way to install is from PyPI:

`pip install trajectorize`

This will install the latest stable version of the package, and may include pre-compiled binaries for your platform.

The package is still in development, so you may want to install from the latest commit on the `main` branch instead:

Run `pip install git+https://github.com/itchono/trajectorize` to install the package from source.

You will need to have Python 3.8+, and a **C compiler installed** to compile the C code if installing from source. You will also need a C compiler installed if there are no pre-compiled binaries for your platform. If you're on Windows, you can find details about installing a C compiler [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers).

The following platforms/compilers have been tested:
|Platform         |Compiler   |
|-----------------|-----------|
|Windows 10       | MSVC 14.16 (Visual Studio 2017)|
|Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Dev Machine) | GCC 9.4.0 |

# Demos

Right now, full functionality is incomplete. There are, however, some cool demos showing off the capabilities of the package.
