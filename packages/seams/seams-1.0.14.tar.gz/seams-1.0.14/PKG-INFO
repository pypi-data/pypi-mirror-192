Description: # Seams SDK
        
        ## Importing Seams
        The Seams SDK can be integrated into any Python file by simply calling an import statement and then initializing a new Seams class.
        
        ```python
        from seams import Seams
        
        seams = Seams()
        ```
        
        ## Set Pythonpath for testing
        You must set the pythonpath to the Seams SDK if you wish to run the test files
        
        ```bash
        set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%,C:\Users\{user}\repos\seams-sdk\seams
        ```
        
        ## Connecting to the Seams API
        To connect to the Seams API just run the connect() function and pass in the secret, app id, and tenant id, which all should have been given to you by an RJLG employee. The connect() function will not return anything. Once you call the connect() function you can then call seams.bearer to get the bearer token if desired. The bearer token is recorded in the Seams() class and used for each connection behind the scenes.
        
        ```python
        seams.connect(APP_SECRET, APP_ID, TENANT_ID)
        print(seams.bearer)
        ```
        
        ## Seams connection information
        After you run seams.connect() you'll be able to run seams.whoami() which will return a JSON formatted string of everything that makes up the seams API connection, including: bearer token, API URL, connection status, and the secret, app id, and tenant id that you provided during the connection. Note: if whoami() is run without running connect() first then it will only return the URL and the connected status of False.
        
        ```python
        seams.whoami()
        ```
        
        Returns:
        ```json
        "{'bearer': 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjYwNmYyYzgwYTcwZjAzN2JlNGYyZmJkZiIsImlhdCI6MTY0ODU4MTk0MywiZXhwIjoxNjQ4NjY4MzQzfQ.U1r4UZgt8MihfKGyHDwkVdFb9_X4-SlM_kvM-JVb3AU', 'url': 'http://localhost:4010/api', 'connected': True, 'secret': '1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'app_id': '123456-7891-0123-4567-hgsfdhsd897', 'tenant_id': 'hgsfdhsd897-321-521-7895-asd;ghsad6565'}"
        ```
        
        ## Verifying Connection
        To verify that you are connected you can call the me() function which currently returns a giant blob of JSON that represents the graph DB for all the tenants.
        
        ```python
        response = seams.me()
        ```
        
        ## Disconnecting from Seams
        To disconnect from the Seams SDK call the disconnect() method. This is not required as there are no active connections open, but it is still best practice. 
        ```python
        seams.disconnect()
        ```
        
        # Vertex Methods
        
        ## Vertex test file
        The vertex test file is located at /Seams/seams/tests/test_vertices.py
        
        ## Getting vertex by ID
        To get a vertex by the vertex ID you can call the get_vertex_by_id(tenantId, id) function. You'll need the tenant id and vertex id to be able to call this function. 
        
        ```python
        vertex = seams.get_vertex_by_id('61a5008ba5d83d6a3931594b', '704480ce-4e18-47b5-ae41-24cc9c61c075')
        ```
        
        ## Getting vertices by label
        To get all vertices under the same label you can call the get_vertices_by_label(tenantId, label). You'll need the tenant id and the label name to be able to call this function. 
        
        ```python
        label = seams.get_vertices_by_label('61a5008ba5d83d6a3931594b', "Chamber")
        ```
        
        ## Updating a vertex
        To update a vertex call the update_vertex method with 3 required arguments: Tenant Id, Vertex Id, and Vertex Label. The last, optional parameter, is a dictionary of key/value pairs that will represent the data fields of the vertex.
        
        ```python
        attributes = {
            'type':'Manganin', 
            'location':'upper right corner', 
            'description': 'This is a test vertex created from the sdk'
        }
        
        update = seams.update_vertex(tenants['tenant_id'], 'de7f9c4b-748e-4887-a066-8dc1ba8eec4f', 'Manganin Sensor', attributes)
        ```
        
        ## Upserting a vertex
        The upsert_vertex() function can be used to first check to see if a vertex with the given label exists, if it does exist then it will update the vertex with the given attributes, if it doesn't exist it will create the vertex. upsert_vertex() has 3 required arguments, tenant_id, vertex_label, and vertex_name; these are all strings. The last, optional parameter, is a dictionary of key/value pairs that will represent the data fields of the vertex.
        
        ```python
        print("calling upsert_vertex")
        upsert = seams.upsert_vertex(tenants["Digital Twin"], "Subject","Test Subject 1", attributes)
        print(upsert)
        ```
        
        ## Creating a vertex
        To create a vertex call the create_vertex method with 3 required arguments: Tenant Id, Vertex Label, and Vertex Name. The last, optional parameter, is a dictionary of key/value pairs that will represent the data fields of the vertex.
        
        ```python
        attributes = {
            'type':'Manganin', 
            'location':'upper right corner', 
            'description': 'This is a test vertex created from the sdk'
        }
        
        create = seams.create_vertex(tenants['tenant_id'], 'Manganin Sensor', 'Manganin Sensor 1', attributes)
        ```
        
        ## Deleting a vertex
        To delete a vertex call the delete_vertex method with 2 required arguments: Tenant Id and Vertex Id
        
        ```python
        delete = seams.delete_vertex(tenants['tenant_id'], create['id'])
        ```
        
        ## Finding the edges on a vertex
        To find the vertices from a specific type of edge off of a vertex use the get_edge_vertices method. This method has 3 required arguments: Tenant Id, Vertex Id and direction.
        
        ```python
        edges_out = seams.get_edge_vertices(tenants['tenant_id'], '9e2e8dcd-1b68-4b06-ab41-045d78f62e38', "Test", "out")
        edges_in = seams.get_edge_vertices(tenants['tenant_id'], '9e2e8dcd-1b68-4b06-ab41-045d78f62e38', "Test", "in")
        ```
        
        
        # Edge Methods
        
        ## Edge test file
        The edge test file is located at /Seams/seams/tests/test_edges.py
        
        ## Attaching edges to a vertex
        To attach an edge to a vertex call the attach_edges method with 3 required arguments: Tenant Id, Vertex Id and a list of edges that you want to attach to the vertex.
        
        ```python
        attributes = {
            'type':'Manganin', 
            'location':'upper right corner', 
            'description': 'This is a test vertex created from the sdk'
        }
        vertex_1 = seams.create_vertex(tenants['tenant_id'], 'Manganin Sensor', attributes)
        vertex_2 = seams.create_vertex(tenants['tenant_id'], 'Manganin Sensor', attributes)
        vertex_3 = seams.create_vertex(tenants['tenant_id'], 'Manganin Sensor', attributes)
        
        vertex_list = []
        vertex_list.append(vertex_1['id'])
        vertex_list.append(vertex_2['id'])
        vertex_list.append(vertex_3['id'])
        
        set_edges = seams.attach_edges(tenants['tenant_id'], "9e2e8dcd-1b68-4b06-ab41-045d78f62e38", vertex_list)
        ```
        
        ## Attaching a label TO an edge
        To attach a label to an edge call the attach_label_to_edge method with 4 required arguments: Tenant Id, Parent Vertex Label, Edge Label and Vertex Id.
        
        ```python
        set_label_to = seams.attach_label_to_edge(tenants['tenant_id'], "Manganin Sensor", "Manganin Sensor", vertex_1['id'])
        ```
        
        ## Attaching a label FROM an edge
        To attach a label from an edge call the attach_label_from_edge method with 4 required arguments: Tenant Id, Parent Vertex Id, Edge Name and Child Label.
        
        ```python
        set_label_from = seams.attach_label_from_edge(tenants['tenant_id'], vertex_2['id'], "Manganin Sensor", "Manganin Sensor")
        ```
        
        
        # File Methods
        
        ## File test file
        The file test file is located at /Seams/seams/tests/test_files.py
        
        ## Bulk upload files
        To upload multiple files call the upload_files method which has 1 required argument, Tenant Id, followed by any number of filenames the user wishes to upload.
        
        ```python
        file1 = open('file-To-Upload.txt', 'w')
        file1.write("This is a test text file that is being uploaded and downloaded from the Python SDK.")
        file1.close()
        file2 = open('secondFileToUpload.txt', 'w')
        file2.write("This is a second test text file that is being uploaded and downloaded from the Python SDK.")
        file2.close()
        
        upload = seams.upload_files(tenants['tenant_id'], 'file-To-Upload.txt', 'secondFileToUpload.txt')
        ```
        
        ## Bulk download files
        To download multiple files call the download_files method which has 1 required argument, Tenant Id, followed by any number of Vertex Id's the user wishes to download. 
        
        ```python
        download = seams.download_files(tenants['tenant_id'], upload[0]['id'], upload[1]['id'])
        for item in download:
            file3 = open(item, 'w')
            file3.write(download[item])
            file3.close()
            print("filename: ", item)
            with open(item, 'r') as f:
                print(f.read())
        ```
        This method will return a JSON formatted object like:
        ```json
        {
           "file-To-Upload.txt":"This is a test text file that is being uploaded and downloaded from the Python SDK.",
           "secondFileToUpload.txt":"This is a second test text file that is being uploaded and downloaded from the Python SDK."
        }
        ```
