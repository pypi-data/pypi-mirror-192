# IMPORTANT:
# pyproject.toml has several different formats (such as a [project] section);
# however, pip will NOT install unless I base pyproject.toml on the
# [tool.poetry] section below.
#
# Maybe it's my fault, but I have not had success trying to migrate to 
# a [project] section with pip installs.  I have stopped trying because
# the problem is too complicated to continue throwing cycles at making a
# [project] section work with 'pip install ciscoconfparse'.
