# drfaster
Optimizations to the predictions process


## Local Release process

0. Update HISTORY.rst:

```shell script
vi HISTORY.rst
```

1. Update version in setup.py

```shell script
# for sanity that you see the right version built.
make sdist
```

2. Open PR and merge to master. Find the standalone job in jenkins to publish the package. This will start a CD process that publishes to artifactory, test-pypi, and pypi.

3. Create a PR in the `quantum-builders` repository.  Modify the file `libraries/python_sci.matrix.yaml`. Add a new entry for the new version: copy&paste the previous entry and update the version number, unless you have made changes to how drfaster builds.

4. (OPTIONAL) To run the full build locally (for testing purposes, NOT required, builds in a Docker Container with the standard DataRobot compiler version and other infrastructure), run:

```shell script
pip install . ; quantum-python drfaster
```
