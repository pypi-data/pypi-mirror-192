    Detects major peaks in an audio file. A major peak is a peak that is one of the highest in its local region.

    of that peak. (For example, suppose the highest peak is 1, and the min_percentage_of_max is 0.9. Then any peak with

    Detects loop points in an audio sample. Loop points are frame indices that could be used for

    1. The standard deviation of peak amplitudes should be minimized (i.e. the loop is not increasing or decreasing in amplitude)
