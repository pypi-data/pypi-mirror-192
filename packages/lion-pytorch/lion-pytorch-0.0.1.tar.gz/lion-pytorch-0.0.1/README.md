## Lion - Pytorch

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06675">Lion</a>, new optimizer discovered by Google Brain that is purportedly better than Adam(w), in Pytorch. This is nearly a straight copy from <a href="https://github.com/google/automl/blob/master/lion/lion_pytorch.py">here</a>, with few minor modifications.

It is so simple, we may as well get it accessible and used asap by everyone to train some great models, if it really works ðŸ¤ž

Update: seems to work for my local enwik8 autoregressive language modeling

## Install

```bash
$ pip install lion-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
# toy model

import torch
from torch import nn

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)

# import Lion and instantiate with parameters

from lion_pytorch import Lion

opt = Lion(model.parameters(), lr = 1e-4)

# forward and backwards

loss = model(torch.randn(10))
loss.backward()

# optimizer step

opt.step()
opt.zero_grad()
```
