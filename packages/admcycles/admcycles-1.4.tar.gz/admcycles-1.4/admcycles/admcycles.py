        r"""
        Computes the quotient graph of self under the group action.

        dicv, dicl are dictionaries that record the quotient map of vertices and legs,
        dicvinv is a dictionary giving some section of dicv (going from vertices of
        quotient to vertices of self).
        If relabel=False, the legs of the quotient graph are labeled with the
        label of their smallest preimage. Otherwise, the labels are normalized
        to 1,...,n such that the ordering of the labels is preserved.

# TODO: storing the data as (unordered) lists is very inefficient!

    r"""
    Polynomial in kappa and psi-classes on a common stable graph.

    The data is stored as a list monomials of entries (kappa,psi) and a list
    coeff of their coefficients. Here (kappa,psi) is a monomial in kappa, psi
    classes, represented as

    - ``kappa``: list of length self.gamma.num_verts() of lists of the form [3,0,2]
      meaning that this vertex carries kappa_1**3*kappa_3**2

    - ``psi``: dictionary, associating nonnegative integers to some legs, where
      psi[l]=3 means that there is a psi**3 at this leg for a kppoly p. The values
      can not be zero.

    If ``p`` is such a polynomial, ``p[i]`` is of the form ``(kappa,psi,coeff)``.

    pi is the universal curve over the moduli space, psi_{n+1} is the psi-class
    at the marking n+1 that is forgotten by pi.

    r"""
    Return the indices of a basis of `R^r(\bar M_{g,n})` in terms of the standard list of generators.

    This function assumes that the generalized Faber-Zagier relations [PPZ15]_
    are a complete set of relations. For most parameters this is computed by
    using the FZ-relations. However, if r is greater than half the dimension of
    \bar M_{g,n} and all cohomology is tautological, we rather compute a
    generating set using Poincare duality and the intersection pairing


    INPUT:

    FZ : bool (default: True)
      Whether FZ relations are used to compute the basis. If False (only for moduli='st'),
      instead compute basis by pairing matrix from opposite degree.

    FZmethod : string (default: None)
      Which method is to be used for computing FZ relations, the options are '3spin' and 'newrels'.
      If no method is supplied we use the 3-spin formula when ``r`` < 3 and
      the new relation method otherwise.

    moduli : string (default: 'st')
      If instead of 'st' one of 'ct', 'rt' or 'sm' is given, compute a basis for the tautological
      ring of the corresponding open subset of `\bar M_{g,n}`.

def Hidentify(g, dat, method='pull', vecout=False, redundancy=False, markings=None):
    r"""
    Identifies the (pushforward of the) fundamental class of \bar H_{g,dat} in
    terms of tautological classes.

    INPUT:

    - ``g``  -- integer; genus of the curve C of the cover C -> D

    - ``dat`` -- HurwitzData; ramification data of the cover C -> D

    - ``method`` -- string (default: `'pull'`); method of computation

      method='pull' means we pull back to the boundary strata and recursively
      identify the result, then use linear algebra to restrict the class of \bar H
      to an affine subvectorspace (the corresponding vector space is the
      intersection of the kernels of the above pullback maps), then we use
      intersections with kappa,psi-classes to get additional information.
      If this is not sufficient, return instead information about this affine
      subvectorspace.

      method='pair' means we compute all intersection pairings of \bar H with a
      generating set of the complementary degree and use this to reconstruct the
      class.

    - ``vecout`` -- bool (default: `False`); return a coefficient-list with respect
      to the corresponding list of generators tautgens(g,n,r).
      NOTE: if vecout=True and markings is not the full list of markings 1,..,n, it
      will return a vector for the space with smaller number of markings, where the
      markings are renamed in an order-preserving way.

    - ``redundancy`` -- bool (default: `False`); compute pairings with all possible
      generators of complementary dimension (not only a generating set) and use the
      redundant intersections to check consistency of the result; only valid in case
      method='pair'.

    - ``markings`` -- list (default: `None`); return the class obtained by the
      fundamental class of the Hurwitz space by forgetting all points not in
      markings; for markings = None, return class without forgetting any points.

    Checks if the set of generalized Faber-Zagier relations [PPZ15]_ in R^d(Mbar_{g,n}) is complete.

    It does so by comparing the rank of the quotient of the strata algebra by the FZ-relations
    to a lower bound for the rank of the cohomology group R^d(Mbar_{g,n}).

    For method = 'pair', this lower bound is obtained as the rank of a matrix of intersection
    numbers of generators of R^d(Mbar_{g,n}) with generators in opposite degree.

    For method = 'pull', the lower bound arises from the rank of a matrix obtained from
    intersection numbers with kappa-psi-monomials and boundary pullbacks to products of spaces
    Mbar_{gi, ni} for which the FZ-conjecture is checked recursively.

    For quiet = False, the program gives status reports about the progress of the computation.
