# catcoocc

The `catcoocc` library is designed for the study of co-occurrence association
between categorical variables by implementing a number of symmetric and
asymmetric measures of association.

*The library has been expanded and renamed to ASymCat, and can now be found at
[https://pypi.org/project/asymcat/](https://pypi.org/project/asymcat/). The
`catcoocc` version will not be updated and will only be kept to prevent
cybersquatting on PyPI.*
