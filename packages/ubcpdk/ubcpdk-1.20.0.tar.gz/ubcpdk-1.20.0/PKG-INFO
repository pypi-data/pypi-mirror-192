UBC SiEPIC Ebeam PDK from [edx course](https://www.edx.org/course/silicon-photonics-design-fabrication-and-data-ana) for gdsfactory.
It provides a fully python driven flow alternative for the edx course for the most advanced users.


## Installation

### Installation for new python users


If you don't have python installed on your system you can [download the gdsfactory installer](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory/releases) that includes python3, miniconda and all gdsfactory plugins.

### Installation for new gdsfactory users

If you already have python installed. Open Anaconda Prompt and then install the ubcpdk using pip.

```
pip install ubcpdk --upgrade
gf tool install
```



### Installation for developers

For developers you need to `git clone` the GitHub repository, fork it, git add, git commit, git push and merge request your changes.

```
git clone https://github.com/gdsfactory/ubc.git
cd ubc
pip install -e . pre-commit
pre-commit install
python install_tech.py
gf tool install
```

Then you need to restart Klayout to make sure the new technology installed appears.
