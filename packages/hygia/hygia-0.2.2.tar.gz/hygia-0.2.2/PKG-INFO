## What is it?

Hygia is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data pipeline to make working with Machine Learning data easy and intuitive. The library is designed to make it easy for developers and data scientists to work with a wide range of data sources, perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and train models with minimal effort.

One of the key features of Hygia is its support for configuration through YAML files. With the help of a configuration file, users can easily specify the steps they want to run in their data pipeline, including extracting data from various sources, transforming the data, and loading it into the pipeline for processing. This not only makes it easier to automate the pipeline, but also enables users to compare and share their results with others.

In addition, Hygia is designed to support the ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) process, making it an ideal solution for developers and data scientists looking to scale and automate their workflows. With its fast, flexible, and expressive data pipeline configuration, Hygia makes it easy to organize and manage all your ML model, saving time, effort and allowing you to focus on the most important aspects of your work.

## Main Features

- Configure data pipeline through a YAML file
- Execute through command line or python import
- Pack the solution into a Python's Package Manager
- Visualize results in customized dashboards
- Test on different databases

## Check the documentation

If you're looking to use the Hygia library and get a better understanding of how it works, you can check out the comprehensive documentation available at [Hygia Documentation](https://hygia-org.github.io/hygia/). This website provides a wealth of information on the library's capabilities and how to use it.

In addition to the documentation, we also have a number of boilerplates available at [Examples](https://github.com/hygia-org/hygia/tree/main/examples). These boilerplates provide hands-on examples and practical explanations of using the library and the .yaml file, making it easier for you to get started with using Hygia. Whether you're a seasoned data scientist or just starting out, these resources will help you get the most out of the library.
