# RISify

`RISify` is a Python library that provides functions for encoding and decoding 
Regional Indicator Symbols (RIS), which are Unicode characters used to 
represent flags of countries and regions.

## Installation

You can install `RISify` via pip:

```bash
pip install RISify
```

## Usage

```python
from ris import RIS

# decode a country code to RIS
pt = RIS.decode("PT")
print(pt) # ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹

# decode HTML-symbols to RIS
de = RIS.decode("&#127465;&#127466;", encoding="html")
print(de) # ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

# encode a RIS to country code
nl = RIS("ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±")
print(nl.encode()) # NL

# encode a RIS to HTML-safe symbols
fo = RIS("ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡´")
print(fo.encode(encoding="html")) # &#127467;&#127476;
```

Note that `RISify` also provides functions for encoding and decoding RIS as 
HTML-safe symbols, which can be useful for ensuring that the symbols are 
markup-safe when used in HTML
