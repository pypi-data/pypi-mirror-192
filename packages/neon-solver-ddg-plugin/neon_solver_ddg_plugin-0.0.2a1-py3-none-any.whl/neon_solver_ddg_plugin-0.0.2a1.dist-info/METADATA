# Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author widely recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time and among the most influential scientists. He was a key figure in the philosophical revolution known as the Enlightenment. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, first published in 1687, established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus. In the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity.

# Sir Isaac Newton foi um matemático inglês, físico, astrônomo, alquimista, teólogo e autor amplamente reconhecido como um dos maiores matemáticos e físicos de todos os tempos e entre os cientistas mais influentes. Ele era uma figura chave na revolução filosófica conhecida como o Iluminismo. Seu livro Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, publicado pela primeira vez em 1687, estabeleceu a mecânica clássica. Newton também fez contribuições seminais para a óptica, e compartilha crédito com o matemático alemão Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz para desenvolver cálculo infinitesimal. No Principia, Newton formulou as leis do movimento e da gravitação universal que formaram o ponto de vista científico dominante até ser superado pela teoria da relatividade
