Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus. In the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity.

    # Sir Isaac Newton foi um matemÃ¡tico inglÃªs, fÃ­sico, astrÃ´nomo, alquimista, teÃ³logo e autor amplamente reconhecido como um dos maiores matemÃ¡ticos e fÃ­sicos de todos os tempos e entre os cientistas mais influentes. Ele era uma figura chave na revoluÃ§Ã£o filosÃ³fica conhecida como o Iluminismo. Seu livro PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, publicado pela primeira vez em 1687, estabeleceu a mecÃ¢nica clÃ¡ssica. Newton tambÃ©m fez contribuiÃ§Ãµes seminais para a Ã³ptica, e compartilha crÃ©dito com o matemÃ¡tico alemÃ£o Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz para desenvolver cÃ¡lculo infinitesimal. No Principia, Newton formulou as leis do movimento e da gravitaÃ§Ã£o universal que formaram o ponto de vista cientÃ­fico dominante atÃ© ser superado pela teoria da relatividade
