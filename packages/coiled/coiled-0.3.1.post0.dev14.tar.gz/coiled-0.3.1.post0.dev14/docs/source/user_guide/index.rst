ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Coiled's documentation!

How Coiled works
----------------

Coiled handles the creation and management of Dask clusters in the cloud
through a continuously running control plane.

   Coiled Architecture (click image to enlarge)

* **User Environment**

  This is where you use the Coiled Python package along
  with your preferred tools to create Dask clusters and submit Dask
  computations. This could be a Jupyter Notebook on your laptop, a Python script
  on a cloud-hosted VM, or Python code within a task in a workflow management
  system.

* **Coiled Cloud**

  `Coiled Cloud <https://cloud.coiled.io/>`_ provides a dashboard that
  you can use to manage clusters, users, teams, software environments, etc.
  Coiled Cloud also handles provisioning the necessary cloud infrastructure in your cloud account for
  your Dask clusters so you don't have to!

* **Cloud Computing Environment**

  This is the cloud environment where Dask clusters will be created and where
  your Dask computations will run. You can configure Coiled to run in your AWS or Google Cloud account (see :doc:`cli_setup`).


Where does Coiled run?
----------------------

Coiled creates and manages Dask clusters in your own :doc:`cloud provider account <backends>`.

   Use Coiled with GCP
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What can you do with Coiled?
----------------------------

`Coiled <https://coiled.io>`_ provides cluster-as-a-service functionality to
provision hosted Dask clusters on demand. It takes the DevOps out of data
science and enables data engineers and data scientists to spend more time on
their real job and less time setting up networking, managing fleets of Docker
images, etc.
