DESCRIPTION:

This is a simple package I wrote which takes in a string, and will convert the string into a JSON math file.

FUTURE FEATURES:

1. Ability to execute and interpret the math json file, by injecting a config object.
2. A lexer written for latex code.
3. Bug fixed.

BUGGS:

Currently, if a string ends with two digits, an error will be thrown.

CREDIT:

I have never written a language before, this was my first time writing a simple one.
To do this I have learn and followed the wonderful YouTube tutorial by CodePulse on "Writing a simple Math Interpreter"
This is an extenssion of the code to more general calculator for any math object. 
Additionally, instead of computing the expressions, I instead convert it to the MathJson format.
