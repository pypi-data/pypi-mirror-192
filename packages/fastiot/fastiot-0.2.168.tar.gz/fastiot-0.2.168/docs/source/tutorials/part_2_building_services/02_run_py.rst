Service Entry Point - run.py
############################

The entry point for FastIoT created containers is the :file:`run.py`. It is the only process running inside the docker
container, therefore all service functionality must start there. Usually this file is automatically generated when using
the templates for new services and typically look like the following:

.. code:: python

  from my_services.my_service.my_service_mdoule import MyService

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      MyService.main()

You can however completely customize your service if you need to.
