## Usage: 
All functions are meant to be used in `pandas.pipe method`.

from pandstat import ols_model, one_sample_ttest

df = (pd.DataFrame()
      .assign(x=[1,2,3,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5])
     )

(df
 .pipe(one_sample_ttest, 'x')
)

```
*Output:*

|    | term      |    mean |   std_error |       t |     p_value |   conf_low |   conf_high |   n_observations |
|---:|:----------|--------:|------------:|--------:|------------:|-----------:|------------:|-----------------:|
