# Job()
#
# The Job object represents a task that will run in parallel to the main
# process. It has some methods that are not implemented - they are meant for
# you to implement in a subclass.
#
# It has a close relationship with the ChildJob class, and it can be considered
# a two part solution:
#
# 1. A Job instance, which will create a ChildJob instance and arrange for
#    childjob.child_process() to be executed in another process.
# 2. The created ChildJob instance, which does the actual work.
#
# This split makes it clear what data is passed to the other process and what
# is executed in which process.
#
# To set up a minimal new kind of Job, e.g. YourJob:
#
# 1. Create a YourJob class, inheriting from Job.
# 2. Create a YourChildJob class, inheriting from ChildJob.
# 3. Implement YourJob.create_child_job() and YourJob.parent_complete().
# 4. Implement YourChildJob.child_process().
