# quantum-sg

A command line tool that generates a cryptographically secure quantum-level secrets using ANU QRNG.

## Usage

This function generates a random set of secrets using the quantumrandom library. The parameters population, number and length are optional.

```python
from string import digits
from quantum_sg import rand

rand(length=24, number=2, population=digits)
```

## Usage as CLI

```bash
$ pip install quantum-sg
$ quantum-sg -l 24 -n 2

> FkEKjlgm08Ey17HrAeeKKRl4
```

### Options

This command line utility can be used to generate secure secrets of specified length and complexity.

The `-h` or `--help` flag will display a help message to the user with instructions on how to use the utility.

The `-n` or `--number` flag will allow the user to specify the number of secrets to generate. By default, the utility will generate one secret.

The `-l` or `--length` flag will allow the user to specify the length of each generated secret. By default, this length is 24 characters.

The `-wd`, `--digits`, `-wl`, `--lowercase`, `-wu`, `--uppercase`, `-wp` and `--punctuation` flags will allow the user to specify which types of characters should be included in the generated secrets. By default, digits, lowercase characters, and uppercase characters are included.
