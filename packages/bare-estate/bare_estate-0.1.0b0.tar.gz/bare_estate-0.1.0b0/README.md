# Bare Estate

This project was based on a [blog post](https://stegosaurusdormant.com/bare-git-repo/)
written by Greg Owen, which in turn was based on a
[post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797) by StreakyCobra on Hacker
News.

Basically, it is a wrapper script to use git specifically for managing dotfiles
using a bare repository.
