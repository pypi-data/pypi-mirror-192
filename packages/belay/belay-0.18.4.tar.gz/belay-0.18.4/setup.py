On-device firmware (usually C or MicroPython) for directly handling hardware interactions. Typically this is developed, compiled, and uploaded as a (nearly) independent project.\n\n2. A program on your computer that performs the tasks specified and interacts with the device.\n\n3. Computer-to-device communication protocol. How are commands and results transferred? How does the device execute those commands?\n\nThis is lot of work if you just want your computer to do something simple like turn on an LED.\nBelay simplifies all of this by merging steps 1 and 2 into the same codebase, and manages step 3 for you.\nCode is automatically synced at the beginning of script execution.\n\nThe Belay Package Manager makes it easy to cache, update, and deploy third party libraries with your project.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nBelay requires Python ``>=3.8`` and can be installed via:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   pip install belay\n\nThe MicroPython-compatible board only needs MicroPython installed; no additional preparation is required.\nIf using CircuitPython, and additional modification needs to be made to ``boot.py``. See `documentation <https://belay.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CircuitPython.html>`_ for details.\n\nExamples\n========\n\nTurning on an LED with Belay takes only 6 lines of code.\nFunctions decorated with the ``task`` decorator are sent to the device and interpreted by the MicroPython interpreter.\nCalling the decorated function on-host sends a command to the device to execute the actual function.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n   import belay\n\n   device = belay.Device("/dev/ttyUSB0")\n\n\n   @device.task\n   def set_led(state):\n       print(f"Printing from device; turning LED to {state}.")\n       Pin(25, Pin.OUT).value(state)\n\n\n   set_led(True)\n\nOutputs from ``print`` calls from on-device user-code are forwarded to host ``stdout``.\n\n`For more examples, see the examples folder.`_\n\n\n.. |GHA tests| image:: https://github.com/BrianPugh/belay/workflows/tests/badge.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/BrianPugh/belay/actions?query=workflow%3Atests\n   :alt: GHA Status\n.. |Codecov report| image:: https://codecov.io/github/BrianPugh/belay/coverage.svg?branch=main\n   :target: https://codecov.io/github/BrianPugh/belay?branch=main\n   :alt: Coverage\n.. |readthedocs| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/belay/badge/?version=latest\n        :target: https://belay.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n        :alt: Documentation Status\n.. |Python compat| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/>=python-3.8-blue.svg\n.. |PyPi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/belay.svg\n        :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/belay\n.. _Quick Video of Belay in 22 seconds.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq3cyjSE8ek\n.. _the documentation: https://belay.readthedocs.io\n.. _For more examples, see the examples folder.:  https://github.com/BrianPugh/belay/tree/main/examples\n',
