# CuttApi
One of the best URL shortener module for Python of all time!


CuttApi is one of the best ways of shortening URLs using Cuttly URL shortener just by entering your API key and seeing the rest that is done automatically by the Module







## Installation

Installing requirements to establish the Module :

```sh
requests
urllib3
pyperclip
```
**Use pip to Install the above Modules**


## Usage
The only thing users need to do is
```sh
from CuttApi import Cuttshort
import stdiomask
api_key = stdiomask.getpass("Enter your Cuttly api key: ")
short = Cuttshort(api_key)
```

- If you enter the correct API key, then you proceed.
- But if you enter a wrong one, you proceed only after entering the correct one.
- As you proceed, the same thing happens with Links and Alias (if you wanna give), but that's good since the process doesn't start over from the start of entering the API key.

## Hidden Class
Cuttshort class is supported by one more class which is a URL corrector as well as checker!
```sh
from CuttApi import (hidden_class)
a = (hidden_class)("google.com").link
print(a)
```
This returns https://www.google.com/
And that happens whether you put :-
- google.com
- http://google.com
- https://google.com
- google.com/
- http://google.com/
- https://google.com/
- www.google.com
- http://www.google.com
- https://www.google.com
- www.google.com/
- http://www.google.com/
- https://www.google.com/

Try for twitter.com or for any other link and let CuttApi know on the e-mail id mentioned!

```diff
Note :-

This can only take place after you identify the class name!

Try asking the net ;)
```

## Privacy
CuttApi developer respects your privacy! The data you enter does not go over the net except to CuttLy for creations and updates. The data you enter is safely stored on your device, so that you can work on links and find them easily!

Please keep the following points in my mind :-
- Don't delete the file to make sure you have the best experience!
- The file is stored with the name as your API key, so any updates by the user can cause the user not being able to use the latest feature.
- Multiple API keys can be used on the same device :)
