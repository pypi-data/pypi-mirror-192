# IPMike

A Python package for geolocating IP addresses using the IPMike API.

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:


```bash
pip install ipmike1
```


You will also need to obtain an API token from the IPMike website in order to use the package. Once you have a token, you can create an instance of the `IPMike` class and use the `get_location` method to geolocate an IP address.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the package to geolocate an IP address:

```python

from ipmike1 import IPMike

# Create a new instance of the IPMike class
ipmike = IPMike()

# Use the get_location method to geolocate an IP address
response = ipmike.get_location("8.8.8.8")

# Print the response, which should be a JSON object containing location data
print(response)
```


The get_location method takes an IP address as a parameter and returns a JSON object containing location data. The API token is automatically included in the request.
