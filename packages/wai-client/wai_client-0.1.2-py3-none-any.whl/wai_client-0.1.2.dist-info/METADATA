# Wai client app

This is a simple command-line or GUI application to query and update a Wai
server.  A [Wai server](https://gitlab.com/dlek/wai-server) is a simple
information service API that stores and provides users' given location and
status.

## What's Wai

Wai is a ridiculously simple server that records the textual location, status
and status emoji for the user to be retrieved by others, such as friends or
colleagues.  The impetus was for the author to advertise on a webpage when
they would next be working on campus.

## Usage

Wai provides a simple graphical user interface and a non-interactive
command-line interface.  They do not necessarily provide the same
functionality.

The app launches in GUI mode when no command (such as `query`) is provided.

**`wai --help`**

```
usage: wai [-h] [-c CONFIG] [--uri URI] [--uuid UUID] {query,update} ...

Query or update location and status information with Wai server.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        configuration file
  --uri URI             URI for Wai server
  --uuid UUID           user ID

actions:
  Perform actions non-interactively. If unspecified, GUI will be launched

  {query,update}
    query               query for current user info
    update              update user info
```

**`wai query --help`**

```
usage: wai query [-h] [--shell]

Query for current user info

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --shell     output results as shell variables
```

**`wai update --help`**

```
usage: wai update [-h] [--key KEY] [--location LOCATION] [--status STATUS] [--emoji EMOJI]

Update user information

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --key KEY            user's API key
  --location LOCATION  set location
  --status STATUS      set status
  --emoji EMOJI        set emoji status
```

## Configuration file

The Wai client will look for a configuration file as specified on the command
line or in either of `$HOME/.config/wai/wai.conf` or `$HOME/.wai`.  This
example shows the format:

```
[wai]
uri = <URI of Wai server>
uuid = <uuid given at registration>
key = <key used to register>
```

## Limitations

The Wai client does not currently support registration.
