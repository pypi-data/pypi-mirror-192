Each VM must be assigned to a site and/or cluster, and may optionally be assigned to a particular host device within a cluster. Virtual machines may have virtual interfaces assigned to them, but do not support any physical component. When a VM has one or more interfaces with IP addresses assigned, a primary IP for the device can be designated, for both IPv4 and IPv6. Fields Name The virtual machine's configured name. Must be unique to the assigned cluster and tenant. Role The functional role assigned to the VM. Status The VM's operational status. !!! tip Additional statuses may be defined by setting VirtualMachine.status under the FIELD_CHOICES configuration parameter. Site & Cluster The site and/or cluster to which the VM is assigned. Device The physical host device within the assigned site/cluster on which this VM resides. Platform A VM may be associated with a particular platform to indicate its operating system. Primary IPv4 & IPv6 Addresses Each VM may designate one primary IPv4 address and/or one primary IPv6 address for management purposes. !!! tip NetBox will prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4 addresses by default. This can be changed by setting the PREFER_IPV4 configuration parameter. vCPUs The number of virtual CPUs provisioned. A VM may be allocated a partial vCPU count (e.g. 1.5 vCPU). Memory The amount of running memory provisioned, in megabytes.
