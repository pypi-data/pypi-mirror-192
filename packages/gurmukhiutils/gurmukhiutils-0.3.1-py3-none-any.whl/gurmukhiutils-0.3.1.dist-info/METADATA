# Gurmukhi Utils

Python utilities library for converting, analyzing, and testing Gurmukhi strings. This project is an original work inspired by the JavaScript library [gurmukhi-utils](https://github.com/shabados/gurmukhi-utils).

## WIP

This library is a work in progress! Note that the API can change unexpectedly when upgrading. It will not be using [SemVer](https://semver.org/) until version 1.0.0. Please do not use for critical projects yet.

## Installation

```shell
pip3 install gurmukhiutils
```

```shell
poetry add gurmukhiutils
```

## Usage

This is a cursory overview of the functions available. To learn more, see any function's docstring in the source code.

**Module `gurmukhiutils.unicode`**

- `unicode` - Converts any ascii gurmukhi characters and sanitizes to unicode gurmukhi. Supports markup language of [Sant Lipi](https://github.com/shabados/SantLipi).
- `unicode_normalize` - Normalizes Gurmukhi according to Unicode Standards.
- `sort_diacritics` - Orders the gurmukhi diacritics in a string according to Unicode standards.
- `sanitize_unicode` - Use single char representations of constructed characters.

**Module `gurmukhiutils.convert`**

Converts text from a script to another. Currently only supports lossless Gurmukhi to Roman transliteration. Gurmukhi to Roman transcription is a WIP.

**Module `gurmukhiutils.remove`**

- `remove` - Removes substrings from string.
- `remove_regex` - Removes regex patterns from string.
- `remove_line_endings` - Attempts to remove line endings as best as possible.
- `remove_vishrams` - Removes all vishram characters.

**`gurmukhiutils.ascii`** - Converts Gurmukhi to ASCII for Open Gurbani Akhar font.

**Example**

```python
>>> from gurmukhiutils.unicode import unicode
>>> unicode("gurU")
'ਗੁਰੂ'

>>> from gurmukhiutils.convert import convert
>>> convert("ਗੁਰੂ")
'gurū'
```
