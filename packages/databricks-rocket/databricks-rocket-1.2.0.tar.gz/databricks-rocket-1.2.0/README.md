![PyPI downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/databricks-rocket)

Keep your local python scripts installed and in sync with a databricks notebook.
Every change on your local machine is automatically applied to the notebook.
Shortens the feedback loop to develop git based projects.
Removes the need to setup a local development environment.

## Installation

```sh
pip3 install databricks-rocket
```

Please sure your python interpreter is 3.7 or higher.

## Setup

Make sure you have a databricks token exported in your environment.

```sh
export DATABRICKS_TOKEN="mydatabrickstoken"
```

If your project is not a pip package already you have to turn it into one. You can use dbrocket to do that.

```sh
dbrocket setup
```

Will create a setup.py for you.

## Using db-rocket

```sh
dbrocket launch
```

The command returns the exact command you have to perform in your notebook next.

Example:

```sh
We are now building your Python repo as a library...
Done! in your notebook install the library by running:

%pip install --upgrade pip
%pip install /dbfs/temp/username/databricks_rocket-1.1.3-py3-none-any.whl --force-reinstall
```

Create a cell in a notebook and paste the content (example below).
