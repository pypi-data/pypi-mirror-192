# dear imgui: Renderer Backend for modern OpenGL with shaders / programmatic pipeline
# - Desktop GL: 2.x 3.x 4.x
# - Embedded GL: ES 2.0 (WebGL 1.0), ES 3.0 (WebGL 2.0)
# This needs to be used along with a Platform Backend (e.g. GLFW, SDL, Win32, custom..)

# Implemented features:
#  [X] Renderer: User texture binding. Use 'GLuint' OpenGL texture identifier as None*/ImTextureID. Read the FAQ about ImTextureID!
#  [X] Renderer: Multi-viewport support (multiple windows). Enable with 'io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_ViewportsEnable'.
#  [x] Renderer: Large meshes support (64k+ vertices) with 16-bit indices (Desktop OpenGL only).

# You can use unmodified imgui_impl_* files in your project. See examples/ folder for examples of using this.
# Prefer including the entire imgui/ repository into your project (either as a copy or as a submodule), and only build the backends you need.
# If you are new to Dear ImGui, read documentation from the docs/ folder + read the top of imgui.cpp.
# Read online: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/docs

# About GLSL version:
#  The 'glsl_version' initialization parameter should be None (default) or a "#version XXX" string.
#  On computer platform the GLSL version default to "#version 130". On OpenGL ES 3 platform it defaults to "#version 300 es"
#  Only override if your GL version doesn't handle this GLSL version. See GLSL version table at the top of imgui_impl_opengl3.cpp.

# dear imgui: Platform Backend for GLFW
# This needs to be used along with a Renderer (e.g. OpenGL3, Vulkan, WebGPU..)
# (Info: GLFW is a cross-platform general purpose library for handling windows, inputs, OpenGL/Vulkan graphics context creation, etc.)
# (Requires: GLFW 3.1+. Prefer GLFW 3.3+ for full feature support.)

# Implemented features:
#  [X] Platform: Clipboard support.
#  [X] Platform: Keyboard support. Since 1.87 we are using the io.AddKeyEvent() function. Pass ImGuiKey values to all key functions e.g. ImGui::IsKeyPressed(ImGuiKey_Space). [Legacy GLFW_KEY_* values will also be supported unless IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_KEYIO is set]
#  [X] Platform: Gamepad support. Enable with 'io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableGamepad'.
#  [x] Platform: Mouse cursor shape and visibility. Disable with 'io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NoMouseCursorChange' (note: the resizing cursors requires GLFW 3.4+).
#  [X] Platform: Multi-viewport support (multiple windows). Enable with 'io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_ViewportsEnable'.

# Issues:
#  [ ] Platform: Multi-viewport support: ParentViewportID not honored, and so io.ConfigViewportsNoDefaultParent has no effect (minor).
