        Content type and workflow for Plone
        
        Features
        --------
        
        1) Forum Page is added, it is hidden for everyone but owner and admins
        2) Forum page is ‘published’, it is visible for owner, admins and ALL MEMBERS
        3) Comments can be enabled as usual
        4) The content type does not show by default in menus (add it in the control panel, navigation settings if you want this
        5) Content item should be hidden from ‘folder views’ for 'not members', I have not tested this test, but should work: (The permissions should be ‘access content information’, if I remember right
