`revsymg` is a Python3 API to store succession relationships between oriented fragments (in forward or reverse orientation) that have been sequenced from nucleotide sequence(s) in an oriented graph.
For example, this API can be used for a genome assembly overlap-layout-consensus method.


You can find the complete [documentation here](https://pyrevsymg.readthedocs.io)


## Quick installation

To install the `revsymg` package from the [PyPI repository](https://pypi.org/project/revsymg/), run the `pip` command :
```sh
pip install revsymg
```

You can find more installation details in the [docs/src/install.md](docs/src/install.md) file.


## Quick usage example

```python
from revsymg.graphs import RevSymGraph
from revsymg.lib import FORWARD_INT, REVERSE_INT


#
# Create an empty graph
#
graph = RevSymGraph()
vertices = graph.vertices()
edges = graph.edges()

#
# Add two vertices v and w that represents e.g. DNA fragments
#
frag_1_index = vertices.add()  # = 0
frag_2_index = vertices.add()  # = 1

#
# Add to the graph the overlap v reverse overlaps w forward
#
frag_1_r = (frag_1_index, REVERSE_INT)
frag_2_f = (frag_2_index, FORWARD_INT)
overlap_index = edges.add(frag_1_r, frag_2_f)  # = 0

for u, v, edge_index in edges:
    print(
        f'Predecessor:\t{u}\n'
        f'Successor:\t{v}\n'
        f'Edge index:\t{edge_index}\n',
    )
# The for-loop print this:
#
#   Predecessor:    (1, 1)
#   Successor:      (0, 0)
#   Edge index:     0
#
#   Predecessor:    (0, 1)
#   Successor:      (1, 0)
#   Edge index:     0
#
```
