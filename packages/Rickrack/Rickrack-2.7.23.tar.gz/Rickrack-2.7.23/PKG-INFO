        # Introduction
        Colors enrich our world and affect our emotions. For artists, they display objects and convey feelings by varied colors in photos, images and drawings. For scientist, they present data by distinguishable colors in figures and graphics. However, currently most color generator softwares and websites place restrictions on users, such as can't export color palette into local individual files, don't provide invocation interfaces, relying on cloud storages, requiring registrations and networks, regional limitations and (or) collecting user's privacies.
        
        Rickrack is designed for you if you are troubled by these restrictions!
        
        Rickrack is a free color editor. It is designed for generating a set of harmonious colors from color wheel or elsewhere. You can share these colors with your friends, or apply them into your creative works. You can store your favorite color sets and color boards in this software, and get them at next time. What's more, you could export color sets or color depots into individual files, backup them anywhere, share them with your friends, or import them into other softwares (such as Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Krita, Pencil 2D and Clip Studio Paint). Rickrack is written in PyQt5, which performs well on Windows, Linux and other mainstream operating systems.
        
        Rickrack include two parts: software and module. **The Rickrack software** is designed for generating and managing harmonious colors. **The Rickrack module** is designed for obtain colors from software in real-time and plot images combined with other modules (such as Matplotlib and Turtle).
