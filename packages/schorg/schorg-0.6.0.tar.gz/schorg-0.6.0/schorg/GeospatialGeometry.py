        geoCovers: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): Represents a relationship between two geometries (or the places they represent), relating a covering geometry to a covered geometry. "Every point of b is a point of (the interior or boundary of) a". As defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM).
        geoWithin: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): Represents a relationship between two geometries (or the places they represent), relating a geometry to one that contains it, i.e. it is inside (i.e. within) its interior. As defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM).
        geoOverlaps: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): Represents a relationship between two geometries (or the places they represent), relating a geometry to another that geospatially overlaps it, i.e. they have some but not all points in common. As defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM).
        geoEquals: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): Represents spatial relations in which two geometries (or the places they represent) are topologically equal, as defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM). "Two geometries are topologically equal if their interiors intersect and no part of the interior or boundary of one geometry intersects the exterior of the other" (a symmetric relationship).
        geoCrosses: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): Represents a relationship between two geometries (or the places they represent), relating a geometry to another that crosses it: "a crosses b: they have some but not all interior points in common, and the dimension of the intersection is less than that of at least one of them". As defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM).
        geoDisjoint: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): Represents spatial relations in which two geometries (or the places they represent) are topologically disjoint: "they have no point in common. They form a set of disconnected geometries." (A symmetric relationship, as defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM).)
        geoIntersects: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): Represents spatial relations in which two geometries (or the places they represent) have at least one point in common. As defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM).
        geoTouches: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): Represents spatial relations in which two geometries (or the places they represent) touch: "they have at least one boundary point in common, but no interior points." (A symmetric relationship, as defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM).)
        geoCoveredBy: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): Represents a relationship between two geometries (or the places they represent), relating a geometry to another that covers it. As defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM).
        geoContains: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): Represents a relationship between two geometries (or the places they represent), relating a containing geometry to a contained geometry. "a contains b iff no points of b lie in the exterior of a, and at least one point of the interior of b lies in the interior of a". As defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM).
