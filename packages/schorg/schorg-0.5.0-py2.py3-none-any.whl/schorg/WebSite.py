A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always  possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.

        mentions: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept.
        publishingPrinciples: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str, AnyUrl]], SchemaOrgObj, str, AnyUrl]]): The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via [[URL]]) a document describing the editorial principles of an [[Organization]] (or individual, e.g. a [[Person]] writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a [[CreativeWork]] (e.g. [[NewsArticle]]) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the [[CreativeWork]].While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a [[funder]]) can be expressed using schema.org terminology.
        contributor: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event.

        accessibilitySummary: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, SchemaOrgObj]], str, SchemaOrgObj]]): A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as "short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users" or "short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed."
        award: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, SchemaOrgObj]], str, SchemaOrgObj]]): An award won by or for this item.

In      the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL.      Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated.

This property was created primarily to    indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. ```10.0``` as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, ```https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0```. There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. ```http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/``` but this has not been carefully explored in the community.
