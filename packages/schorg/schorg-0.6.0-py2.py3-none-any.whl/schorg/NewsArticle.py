    Attributes:
        pageEnd: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, int, str]], SchemaOrgObj, int, str]]): The page on which the work ends; for example "138" or "xvi".
        wordCount: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, int, str]], SchemaOrgObj, int, str]]): The number of words in the text of the Article.
        articleSection: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, SchemaOrgObj]], str, SchemaOrgObj]]): Articles may belong to one or more 'sections' in a magazine or newspaper, such as Sports, Lifestyle, etc.
        articleBody: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, SchemaOrgObj]], str, SchemaOrgObj]]): The actual body of the article.
        speakable: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str, AnyUrl]], SchemaOrgObj, str, AnyUrl]]): Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.The *speakable* property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:1.) *id-value* URL references - uses *id-value* of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of *speakable* has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute. Use the [[cssSelector]] property.3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the [[xpath]] property.For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For thiswe define a supporting type, [[SpeakableSpecification]]  which is defined to be a possible value of the *speakable* property.         
        backstory: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, SchemaOrgObj]], str, SchemaOrgObj]]): For an [[Article]], typically a [[NewsArticle]], the backstory property provides a textual summary giving a brief explanation of why and how an article was created. In a journalistic setting this could include information about reporting process, methods, interviews, data sources, etc.
        pagination: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, SchemaOrgObj]], str, SchemaOrgObj]]): Any description of pages that is not separated into pageStart and pageEnd; for example, "1-6, 9, 55" or "10-12, 46-49".
        pageStart: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, int, str]], SchemaOrgObj, int, str]]): The page on which the work starts; for example "135" or "xiii".

        dateline: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, SchemaOrgObj]], str, SchemaOrgObj]]): A [dateline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline) is a brief piece of text included in news articles that describes where and when the story was written or filed though the date is often omitted. Sometimes only a placename is provided.Structured representations of dateline-related information can also be expressed more explicitly using [[locationCreated]] (which represents where a work was created, e.g. where a news report was written).  For location depicted or described in the content, use [[contentLocation]].Dateline summaries are oriented more towards human readers than towards automated processing, and can vary substantially. Some examples: "BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 2.", "Paris, France", "December 19, 2017 11:43AM Reporting from Washington", "Beijing/Moscow", "QUEZON CITY, Philippines".
