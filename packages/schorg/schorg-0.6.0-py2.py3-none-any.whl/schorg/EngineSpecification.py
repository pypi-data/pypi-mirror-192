Typical unit code(s): KWT for kilowatt, BHP for brake horsepower, N12 for metric horsepower (PS, with 1 PS = 735,49875 W)* Note 1: There are many different ways of measuring an engine's power.

        torque: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): The torque (turning force) of the vehicle's engine.Typical unit code(s): NU for newton metre (N m), F17 for pound-force per foot, or F48 for pound-force per inch* Note 1: You can link to information about how the given value has been determined (e.g. reference RPM) using the [[valueReference]] property.* Note 2: You can use [[minValue]] and [[maxValue]] to indicate ranges.
        engineType: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str, AnyUrl]], SchemaOrgObj, str, AnyUrl]]): The type of engine or engines powering the vehicle.
        fuelType: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str, AnyUrl]], SchemaOrgObj, str, AnyUrl]]): The type of fuel suitable for the engine or engines of the vehicle. If the vehicle has only one engine, this property can be attached directly to the vehicle.
        engineDisplacement: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): The volume swept by all of the pistons inside the cylinders of an internal combustion engine in a single movement. Typical unit code(s): CMQ for cubic centimeter, LTR for liters, INQ for cubic inches* Note 1: You can link to information about how the given value has been determined using the [[valueReference]] property.* Note 2: You can use [[minValue]] and [[maxValue]] to indicate ranges.
