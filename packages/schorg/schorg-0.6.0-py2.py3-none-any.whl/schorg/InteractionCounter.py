        endTime: (Optional[Union[List[Union[datetime, SchemaOrgObj, str]], datetime, SchemaOrgObj, str]]): The endTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to end. For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. E.g. John wrote a book from January to *December*. For media, including audio and video, it's the time offset of the end of a clip within a larger file.Note that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times. This situation may be clarified in future revisions.
        startTime: (Optional[Union[List[Union[datetime, SchemaOrgObj, str]], datetime, SchemaOrgObj, str]]): The startTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to start. For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. E.g. John wrote a book from *January* to December.

This situation may be clarified in future revisions.
        interactionType: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): The Action representing the type of interaction. For up votes, +1s, etc. use [[LikeAction]]. For down votes use [[DislikeAction]]. Otherwise, use the most specific Action.
        interactionService: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, str]], SchemaOrgObj, str]]): The WebSite or SoftwareApplication where the interactions took place.
        userInteractionCount: (Optional[Union[List[Union[SchemaOrgObj, int, str]], SchemaOrgObj, int, str]]): The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication.
        location: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, SchemaOrgObj]], str, SchemaOrgObj]]): The location of, for example, where an event is happening, where an organization is located, or where an action takes place.
