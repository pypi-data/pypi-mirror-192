**CONTRIBUTORS WANTED!!**

# Installation

`pip install python-soql-parser`

or, with poetry

`poetry add python-soql-parser`

# Usage

```python
from python_soql_parser import parse


parse_result = parse("SELECT Id FROM Account")
```

where `parse_result` is a [ParseResults](https://pyparsing-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/HowToUsePyparsing.html#parseresults) object from [pyparsing](https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/).

# Notable caveats

## Unsupported features

- Subqueries (e.g., `SELECT Name, (SELECT LastName FROM Contacts) FROM Account`)
- Aggregate queries
- SOQL specific WHERE-clause tokens (e.g., `LAST_N_DAYS:<integer>`)

## Partially supported

These are either partially supported or weakly supported

- Related attributes (e.g., `SELECT Id, Account.Name FROM Contact`). The object name is not yet parsed out on its own. This will simply parse out `"Account.Name"`

# Contributing

A lot of work remains to be done. Practically no SOQL-specific features are supported as of yet.
If you want to contribute, just open a PR! (and add a test for your new feature)

## Setting up locally

First install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Afterwards, to install the dependencies, run

```
poetry install
```

## Running the tests

Simply execute

```
pytest
```

## House cleaning

Please sort imports with `isort` and format the code with `black` (in that order).
