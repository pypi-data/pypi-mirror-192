Subtitld uses 2 main tools to work. The `ffmpeg` is used for internal processes and `libmpv` for video playback. Also, it uses PySide6 for the GUI. Depending on your system you will need to install PySide6 separatelly. For example, if you use a Ubuntu system, you can install this tools using `apt`:

```
sudo apt install ffmpeg libmpv1
```

Also, Subtitld is written using Python version 3. The majority of modern Linux distributions already have this version installed or at least available. Make sure you have Python 3 on your system. Windows users will need to install it.

### Running from source

You will need to download Subtitld source code. You can download a Zip or Tar package from GitLab project page, but maybe an easier way to download the source code is using `git clone` command, like this:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/jonata/subtitld.git
```

Considering that you have `ffmpeg` and `libmpv` installed, and Python 3 is available on your system, you can install all needed packages using `pip`.

Using the terminal, go to the subtitld folder you just downloaded or cloned and run the command:

```
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

Now you are able to run Subtitld from source. Run the following code:

```
python3 subtitld
```

or just

```
subtitld
```

## Made possible mainly by

* [PySide6](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) - The Qt5 GUI library for Python
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - The absolute solution for media manipulation
* [libmpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) - The powerful MPV media playback engine
