#Lugo4Py

Lugo4Py is a Python3 implementation of a client player for Lugo game.

It is not a bot that plays the game, it is only the client for the game lugo.

This client implements a brainless player in the game. So, this library implements many methods that does not affect the player intelligence/behaviour/decisions. It is meant to reduce the developer concerns on communication, protocols, attributes, etc.

Using this client, you just need to implement the Artificial Intelligence of your player and some other few methods to support your strategy (see the project example folder).
