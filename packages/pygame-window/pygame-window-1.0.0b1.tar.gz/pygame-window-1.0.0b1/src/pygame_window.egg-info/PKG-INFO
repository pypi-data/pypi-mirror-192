Pygame-Window is a Python library that provides an API for managing and
manipulating multiple windows within the Pygame framework, as well as enhancing
their functionalities.

The library uses Pygame's sub-module `pygame._sdl2` to access the low-level
SDL2 library that Pygame is built upon, providing fine-grained control over
window creation and management.

## Installation

Pygame-Window can be installed using pip with the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install pygame-window
```

If you want to install Pygame-Window from source, you can clone the repository
from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zenthm/pygame-window.git
```

Once you have downloaded the source code, you can install Pygame-Window by
running the following command from the root directory of the repository:

```bash
python -m pip install .
```
