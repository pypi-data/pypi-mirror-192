# MELKIT üß∞

A toolkit designed to facilitate the handling of MELCOR/MELGEN `1.8.6` files.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Utilities

- Reading Control Volumes (`CVs`) and Flow Paths (`FLs`) and converting them to objects.
- Writing, deleting and editing `CVs` and `FLs`.
- Plotting files generated by the `EDF` package (`PTF` support is planned!)
- Extraction of values printed by `EDF`.
- Obtaining the list of available/used IDs for certain objects (`CVs`, `FLs`).
- Remove all comments from an input file.
- Search for objects by their ID.
- Search for duplicate objects in a given list.
- Get adjacent `CVs` and `FL` connections for a given `CV`.
- Create submodels from a given `CV` (beta).

## üíª How to use

You simply need to instantiate a `Toolkit` with the name of the MELGEN file to manipulate and call those functions. For example:

```python
from melkit.toolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit(filename)

cvs = toolkit.read_cvs()
fls = toolkit.read_fls()
```
