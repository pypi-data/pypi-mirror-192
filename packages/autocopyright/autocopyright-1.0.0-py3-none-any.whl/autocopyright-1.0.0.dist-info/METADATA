# autocopyright

Autocopyright is a script which was designed to automatically add copyright
notices at the top of source files. It uses jinja2 templates which can be
automatically filled with values pulled from `pyproject.toml` and other files.

## Example

To run autocopyright you must specify comment sign, directory to traverse, glob
patterns of files to modify and path to license template.

```
autocopyright -s "#" -d autocopyright -g "*.py" -g "*.pyi" -l "./templates/MIT.md.jinja2"
```

## Templates

Autocopyright uses Jinja2 templates to determine content of copyright header.
Such template is loaded from predefined destination and rendered with few
special variables available. Those variables are listed below:

- `now` - `datetime.datetime` object holding current time (determined once, at
  the beginning of script execution)

- `pyproject` - dictionary-like object holding loaded content of
  `pyproject.toml` file loaded from current working directory of script.

Template for **LGPL-3.0** license could look like this:

```jinja
Copyright {{ now.year }} {{ pyproject.tool.poetry.authors[0] }}

This file is part of {{ pyproject.tool.poetry["name"] }}.
{{ pyproject.tool.poetry.repository }}
