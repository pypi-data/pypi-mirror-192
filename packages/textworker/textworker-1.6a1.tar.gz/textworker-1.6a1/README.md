## Textworker
[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

A simple and cross-platform Python text editor.

This is an initial port of texteditor to use wxPython - not all features are implemented.

Stuffs you can do with this editor:
* Split tabs and rearrange them like VSCode (but it's a bit limited)
* Access to your files without opening File Explorer
* Run some tasks with Command Window
* Customizable interface
* Auto save! (for the current tab in this time)
