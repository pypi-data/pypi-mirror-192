# MkDocs Tech Docs Template

!!! danger ""

    This template is under construction and should only be used for prototyping

The MkDocs Tech Docs Template is an [MkDocs theme](https://www.mkdocs.org/) that you can use to build technical documentation with a [GOV.UK style](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/). For a demo visit [mkdocs-tech-docs-template](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/mkdocs-tech-docs-template/).

The MkDocs Tech Docs Template is a python-based alternative to the ruby-based Middleman [Tech Docs Template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template) with the following benefits:

- simple to setup, use and customise
- exploits the [MkDocs Materials theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and all it's associated features
- compatible with the vast ecosystem of [MkDocs Plugins](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Plugins), see [plugins](plugins/) for some examples
- unified tech stack for python-based teams and projects
- easy to upgrade as new versions of the theme are released

Youâ€™re welcome to use the MkDocs Tech Docs Template even if your service isnâ€™t considered part of GOV.UK, but your site or service must not:

- identify itself as being part of GOV.UK
- use the crown or GOV.UK logotype in the header
- use the GDS Transport typeface
- suggest that itâ€™s an official UK government website if itâ€™s not
